# 🌌 ISA Summer School 2025 – Supernova Cosmology Project

![Project Banner](plots/Hubble_Diagram.png)

This project was completed as part of the **India Space Academy’s Astronomy & Astrophysics Summer School 2025**.  
Over the course of four weeks, I explored **data-driven astronomy**, focusing on cosmological parameter estimation using observational supernova data.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Using the **Pantheon+SH0ES** supernova dataset, the following were achieved:

- 🧮 Estimated the **Hubble constant (H₀)**
- 🌌 Modeled the **expansion history of the universe** using ΛCDM cosmology
- ⏳ Computed the **age of the universe**
- 📉 Analyzed residuals to assess model accuracy

All analysis was done in Python via Jupyter notebooks.
