# ðŸŒŒ ISA Summer School Projects 2025

This repository contains my submissions and personal explorations for the Indian Summer Astronomy School 2025. I completed one project as part of the official evaluation, and Iâ€™m working on the other two for my own learning and portfolio.

## Projects:

1. **Supernova Cosmology**  
   Estimating the Hubble constant and age of the universe using the Pantheon+SH0ES dataset.

2. **Galaxy Cluster Mass Estimation** *(in progress)*  
   Using redshift dispersion and X-ray data to calculate dynamical mass of galaxy clusters.

3. **JWST Spectral Line Identification** *(in progress)*  
   Detecting emission/absorption lines in NIRSpec data using Python and Astropy.
